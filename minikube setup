1) Install docker desktop on windows using the following link : https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/
                                     OR 
  Run the command on windows command prompt : "Docker Desktop Installer.exe" install


2) Downloading kubectl.exe:
curl.exe -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.29.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe"




Explanation:
curl.exe: This is a command-line tool used to transfer data with URLs. In Windows, it's typically used to download files.
-L: This option tells curl to follow HTTP redirects. If the server redirects the download URL, curl will follow it.
-O: This option tells curl to write the output to a file with the same name as the remote file (in this case, kubectl.exe).
"https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.29.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe": This is the URL from which the kubectl.exe binary is downloaded. 
It specifies the Kubernetes version (v1.29.1), the operating system (Windows), and the architecture (amd64).

3) Downloading SHA256 Checksum:
curl.exe -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/v1.29.1/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe.sha256"



Explanation:
This command is almost identical to the previous one, but it downloads the SHA256 checksum file (kubectl.exe.sha256) instead of the executable itself.
Explanation: The SHA256 checksum is used to verify the integrity of the downloaded kubectl.exe file. 
You can use this checksum to ensure that the file hasn't been corrupted or tampered with during download.

4) Checking kubectl Installation:
kubectl version --client


Explanation:
kubectl: This is the Kubernetes command-line tool.
version: This subcommand displays the version information for kubectl.
--client: This flag specifies that you want to see the client version (the version of kubectl itself).

5)  Installing Minikube:
winget install -e --id Kubernetes.minikube

Explanation:
winget: This is the Windows Package Manager, a command-line tool for installing applications on Windows.
install: This subcommand tells winget to install a package.
-e: This flag specifies that you want to install the exact specified ID, and not a fuzzy search.
--id Kubernetes.minikube: This specifies the ID of the package to install, which is Kubernetes.minikube.

6) Starting a Kubernetes Cluster:
minikube start --driver=docker

Expanation:
minikube: This is the Minikube command-line tool.
start: This subcommand starts a Minikube cluster.
--driver=docker : This flag specifies the driver that Minikube should use to create the virtual machine for the cluster.
Docker is often preferred for performance, if you have docker desktop installed. VirtualBox is an alternative if docker is not available.
